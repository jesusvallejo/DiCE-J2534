# DiCE-J2534
Repository for unbricking DiCE clone J2534


In this repository you can find the firmware and the necessary connections to unbrick the DiCE J2534 clone.
This clone is based in scanmatik SM2, https://scanmatik.pro/es/pages/downloads, my unit worked with Scanmatik 2.21.22.
In case you dont have drivers for your DiCE J2534 based clone you have to install Scanmatik.
It will install SM2 drivers.

If a later version is installed(2.21.26 for example), the update will brick the device. 

If this was the case you are in luck.
There are two versions of the firmware 2.21.22 and 2.21.21. I have only tried 2.21.22.
Program will be bundled in the release zip, for future reference in case the download page is not active any longer.

You must make the SWD connections as show in the pictures.

In case you dont have drivers for
