# DiCE-J2534
Repository for unbricking DiCE clone J2534


In this repository you can find the firmware and the necessary connections to unbrick the DiCE J2534 clone.
This clone is based in scanmatik SM2, https://scanmatik.pro/es/pages/downloads, my unit worked with scanmatik 2.21.22
If a later version is installed, the update will brick the device. If this was the case you are in luck.
There are two versions of the firmware 2.21.22 and 2.21.21. I have only tried 2.21.22.
Program will be bundled in the release zip, for future reference in case the download page is not active any longer.
